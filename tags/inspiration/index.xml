      <description>Words are arguably the most powerful invention of mankind. Someone who can bend language to his will with the power of his ideas, can influence entire generations.
This has always been true. It is the reason Gutenberg&amp;rsquo;s press was such a powerful invention. It was responsible for the explosion of the Renaissance movement in Europe.
It is words from which we too, seek inspiration. Words that have fired our imagination and compel us to turn a utopian dream a reality with whatever tools we have at our disposal.</description>
